To practice building backend code using Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. For a homework project with University of Washington Coding Bootcamp This project allows us to use javascript to interact with MySQL - which allows us to interact with MySQL databases. I learned how to use Express.js at a much more comfortable level. Also, I learned how to build models and routes to access different data within a MySQL databae.
